## Introduction
This repository serves as documentation for Sumobot development, a collaborative work between students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Chile.

Here you will find the design, code, manufacturing and all the necessary documentation to be able to replicate the project and adjust according to the different requirements
## CAD
The different components such as the general assembly of the Sumobot can be found in the following link: [Repositorio](https://grabcad.com/library/sumobot-g3-uchile-1)

## Materials
### General materials
PLA was produced for the manufacture of the main components.
### Electronic materials
The electronic components used are listed below:
* Arduino NANO
* Sensor Ultrasónico HCSR04 (1 un)
* Sensor de Línea TCRT5000 (2 un)
* Motor DC (2un)
* Controlador Motor L298N (1 un)
### Fixing elements
Different bolts and nuts are used to fix all the components.

## Manufacture
The entire project was 3D printed. The printed components are:
1. Wheels (infill 30%)
2. Chasis (infill 20%)
3. Arm (infill 30%)
4. Wheel and motor mounts (infill 35%)

All these components were established with a layer height of 0.2 mm.

The project assembly manual can be found in the repository.

## Electric diagram
